Songs that start with a J
=========================

This is an exercise in using the YouTube Data API to search for videos and add them to a playlist. The result can be found here:

> [YouTube playlist "Songs that start with a J"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYs0aeHq8nRIIkQGFVdEdedShRTE_SDnH)

If you want to create a playlist for yourself, perform the following steps:

- Create a project on the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and enable the "YouTube Data API"

- Add OAuth2 credentials to your project. Save them in a file called `client_secrets.json`.

- Install the Google API Python client:

      $ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

- Place a list of songs that start with your favorite letter in a file named `songs.txt`

- Run `runme.py`

Enjoy!
