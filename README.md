=========================

This is an exercise in using the YouTube Data API to search for videos and add them to a playlist. This is the result:

If you want to create a playlist for yourself, perform the following steps:

1. Create a project on the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and enable the "YouTube Data API"

2. Add OAuth2 credentials to your project. Save them in a file called `client_secrets.json`.

3. Install the Google API Python client:

        $ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

4. Place a list of songs that start with your favorite letter in a file named `songs.txt`

5. Run `runme.py`

Enjoy!
